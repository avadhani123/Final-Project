\f0\fs24 \cf0 My code essentially just searches through twitter data and finds movie data for both imdb and tweets for related movies for the movies Logan, Captain America and Finding Dory.\
I then tried to upload this data onto a database but couldn\'92t figure it out, I then tried to manipulate the code as well using the data processing mechanisms but had a hard time doing that as well.\
I successfully created json files and was able to test my code in the end, and this was all I was capable of doing unfortunately. Thank you though, for a wonderful semester!\
